Eval
====

This Eval API, I create to for my GAE project. Using this a user can Evaluate Mathematical expressions online and get results.
http://ishamsample.appspot.com/eval?q=[user_equation_query] is the URL to get this service for example a user can use this like http://ishamsample.appspot.com/eval?q=4*9
For this query this will return
{4*9}{36}
